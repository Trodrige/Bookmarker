# Todo-app-using-JavaScript

The aim of this project is for me to relearn the basics and advanced concepts of JavaScript.
I actually want to know why certain things are done the way they are in the JavaScript frameworks I've been working with.

This is a simple todo list application. It may not be mobile responsive, but it serves my purpose (JavaScript basics).

I intend to develop it continuously overtime and move it to other frameworks that I'll be learning.

CONTRIBUTION: If you feel as contributing to this small project, FINE, you're welcome.
